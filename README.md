Installation
------------

1. Install python: the python version I used was python 2.7

2. Install pystardict: You can find pystardict from https://github.com/lig/pystardict.git. If you do not wish to install pystardict as a python library you can copy pystardict/src/pystardict.py to the memoria directory.

Execuation
----------

1. Importing word library from text file: You can import a GRE level vocabulary by clicking File->Importâ€¦ and choose gre.txt. A customized library can be built by writing a text file similar to gre.txt.

2. Importing definition of words. You can easily find stardict libraries online. Due to copyright reasons, I am not going to provide such library in the distribution. To import definitions, highlight all wordlists and then Wordlist->Import Definitions

3. Randomize wordlists. Select wordlists in which you want to randomize the order of the words. Then wordlist->randomize.
